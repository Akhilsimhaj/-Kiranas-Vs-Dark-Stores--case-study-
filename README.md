Even though startups such as BigBasket have experimented with the dark stores in the past, the model never gained wide traction in India, unlike the West

But the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased focus on on-demand hyperlocal capabilities in the essentials space has made dark stores more viable for startups despite the relatively higher costs 

Will India’s hyperlocal delivery players and consumer brands gravitate towards dark stores despite some of the drawbacks to meet consumer demand or will kiranas step in to bridge the gap?

The years between 2014 and 2018, can be considered the worst for India’s hyperlocal delivery and logistics startups. The consumer demand for fast and on-demand deliveries had already eaten into the thin margins, and even deep-pocketed players like Grofers, Shadowfax, Peppertap (the B2C business), Local Banya, TownRush, Paytm Zip, Ola Store, Flipkart’s Nearby were retreating from major cities, pivoting to the B2B model or closing the operations.

This was the time when BigBasket first experimented with the dark store model, a concept pioneered by British retail giant and the world’s third-largest retail company Tescos when it started online deliveries. Simply speaking, a dark store is a small neighbourhood warehouse where consumers cannot enter directly and can only order online for a home delivery. Players like Walmart, JCPenney among others have further made it popular in the US with the advent of ecommerce in these regions.

But dark stores need to be seen in a totally different light in India, unlike western markets. As Kushal Nahata, CEO and cofounder of logistics startup FarEye explained, in the west, the supermarkets and department stores at-large serve in a semi-warehouse or dark store for daily order fulfilment. In high-density areas, with high-frequency orders, separate dark store facilities have been installed for faster deliveries.

On the other hand, in India, dark stores have primarily been small warehouses or neighbourhood fulfilment centres serving the objective of on-demand fast deliveries primarily in a D2C (direct to consumer) model.

“At the same time, there is a large network of retail stores across the country, which can actually be used as a dark store facility, rather than creating a parallel supply chain like west,” he added.

The Shift After Covid-19
Dark stores are synonymous with fast and timely deliveries. However, the cost of quick 2-hour or 4-hour delivery through dark stores comes at almost 40% higher cost than traditional slot-based warehouse retail model in India. This makes dark stores difficult to scale for the price-sensitive Indian consumer and business, said Rhitiman Majumder, cofounder and CEO, Pickrr, an end to end tech-enablement service provider for logistics and last-mile delivery players.

The Covid-19 pandemic has created a positive momentum for hyperlocal delivery players serving the essentials segment. While several non-hyperlocal and offline players like Snapdeal, Uber, Domino’s, Quikr, PerPule among others marked their entry in the grocery delivery segment, Dunzo even claimed a 33% higher weekly orders, 2X surge in ticket size when every other player was gasping for revenue.

In line with BigBasket, recently Swiggy launched its dark store pilot ‘Urban Kirana’. The food delivery major has partnered with a number of manufacturers, retailers and B2B grocery players to enable its fulfilment services. It already had Swiggy Stores, which aggregated deliveries from local kirana and department stores.

Then why the move to dark stores? B2B e-commerce platform MaxWholeSale’ founder and CEO Samarth Agrawal says it’s simply because more consumers are looking for options that are not available at the nearest kirana store. In order to take control of inventory, Swiggy is now showcasing its ‘dark store’ warehouse as a store which consumers can directly access on the app for placing orders.

“This way order fulfilment goes up. The purchase orders are raised with the partners on the basis of the last 7 days’ sale, which then refills the dark stores’ inventory on a weekly basis,” Agrawal added.

Also, the timing couldn’t have been better for Swiggy. Due to Covid-19, there has been an aggravated impact on home delivery demand, and consumer behaviour has evolved to look for grocery and essentials rather than cooked meals.

Considering these factors, the delivery costs for dark stores are expected to reduce in proportion to the increasing scale, on the expectation that more and more consumers will be looking for online grocery and quick hyperlocal deliveries.

“This is the most opportunistic time for anyone considering dark stores expansion. We are also expecting the service cost per delivery to be reduced further with deeper penetration of dar stores in the near future,” added Pickrr’s Majumder.

Decoding Dark Stores Viability in India
It would be remiss to assess the long-term viability of dark stores without answering the questions around ownership, maintaining margins, the unit economics, and assessing how they compare to the longstanding traditional warehouse model as well as the kirana stores, which are the lifeblood of hyperlocal retail.

Supply Chain Links
A typical supply chain including traditional warehouse hubs has lower last mile delivery cost, which is assumed by the consumer.

While delivery of goods from warehouse to distributor to retailer might be slow, it’s reasonable to expect a next-day or two-day fulfillment cycle. The same supply chain is applicable for kirana stores too, which receive goods from nearby wholesalers or distributors. Although quick home deliveries are possible through kiranas, this varies from city to city and neighbourhood to neighbourhood.

In comparison, the dark store supply chain gets aggregated at the fulfilment centre and there is no retailer link here. But here, the last-mile delivery costs tend to be much higher than traditional warehouse models, as fast and door-to-door delivery is the basic premise.
